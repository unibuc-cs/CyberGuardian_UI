Here's what you can do to investigate and mitigate the issue:\n\nStep 1: \ud83d\udd0d Gather Information\n\n1.1. Check your server logs to see the IP addresses and query strings of the incoming GET requests.\n\n1.2. Use a tool like `wget` or `curl` to simulate the same request pattern and see if you can reproduce the issue.\n\nStep 2: \ud83d\udd0d Identify the Sources\n\n2.1. Use an IP address tracking tool like `whois` or `ip-adress-info` to determine the location and owner of the IP addresses sending the requests.\n\n2.2. Check if the IP addresses are coming from known malicious IP ranges or IP addresses associated with known botnets or DDoS attackers.\n\nStep 3: \ud83d\udd0d Check for Suspicious Activity\n\n3.1. Monitor your server's CPU and RAM usage to see if the incoming requests are causing any performance issues.\n\n3.2. Check if the requests are causing any database queries or file accesses that could indicate a security vulnerability.\n\nStep 4: \ud83d\udd0d Mitigate the Threat\n\n4.1. Implement a rate limiting mechanism to prevent an excessive number of requests from a single IP address or location.\n\n4.2. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to block suspicious queries or IP addresses.\n\n4.3. Consider implementing CAPTCHA challenges to prevent automated requests.\n\nStep 5: \ud83d\udd0d Continuously Monitor\n\n5.1. Set up monitoring tools to alert you if the issue persists or worsens.\n\n5.2. Regularly review your server logs to identify any new suspicious activity.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the source of the incoming GET requests and mitigate any potential security threats. Remember to stay vigilant and continuously monitor your server for any suspicious activity! \ud83d\ude0a</s>"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Generate me a python code to insert in a pandas dataframe named Firewalls a new IP 10.20.30.40 as blocked under the name of IoTDevice"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " df1 = pd.read_csv(\"../data/SmartHome_DDoSSnapshot/FIREWALL_PROCESSES.csv\")\nnew_row = ('IP': 10.20.30.40, 'NAME': IoTDevice, 'DATE': datetime.now(), 'BLOCKED':1)\ndf1=pd.concat([df1, pd.DataFrame([new_row])], ignore_index=True)\ndf1.to_csv(\"../data/SmartHome_DDoSSnapshot/FIREWALL_PROCESSES.csv\")</s>"}]
