It is a type of cyber attack where the attacker floods the targeted system with a large amount of traffic in an attempt to overwhelm its resources, such as bandwidth or CPU. This can cause the system to become slow or unavailable, and can even lead to the system crashing. DDoS attacks are often used to disrupt online services or to extort money from organizations. They can be launched by individuals or groups, and can be difficult to detect and mitigate."}]}}
